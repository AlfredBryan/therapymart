# Install dependencies
yarn install
```
or
`npm install`

#### 2.1. Run the _React Native_ App

```bash
# Start the React Native packager
yarn start
```
or
`npm start`
#### For android dev
`npm run android`

#### For ios dev
`npm run ios`

Instructions are shown in the terminal. You can select to open it in:

- An emulator (either iOS or Android)
- Your mobile device with the [Expo app](https://expo.io/). It will reload if you save edits to your files and you will see build errors and logs in the terminal.
